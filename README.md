![Newsroom](https://media.giphy.com/media/v2xIous7mnEYg/giphy.gif)

## Background
### Dataset
The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml), but you are free to investigate a different data set. The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

## Your Task

### Core Assignment: D3 Dabbler

![4-scatter](Images/4-scatter.jpg)

We have created a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty`

Using the D3 techniques, we created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. 

We have:

* Included state abbreviations in the circles.

* Created and situated our axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.


### Assessment

Your final product will be assessed on the following metrics:

* Creation of a **new** repository on GitHub called `D3-Challenge` (note the kebab-case). Do not add to an already existing repo.

* Completion of all steps in the core assignment

* Coherency of scatter plot (labels, ticks)

* Visual attraction

* Professionalism

**Good luck!**
