## Background

The goal of this project was to use JavaScript to present a visualization of pre-selected census data from each state within a web page. Since the baseline data was provided in CSV format, D3 was used to import and process the data, as well as generate the required visualization.

### Dataset
The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml), but you are free to investigate a different data set. The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

### Core Assignment: D3 Dabbler

![4-scatter](Images/4-scatter.jpg)

We have created a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty`

Using the D3 techniques, we created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. 

We have:

* Included state abbreviations in the circles.

* Created and situated our axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.
